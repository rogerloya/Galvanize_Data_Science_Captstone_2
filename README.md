Captstone 2 Datasets
- Option 1: Churn for Bank Customers
I want to do various machine learning models to help me predict customer churn. The region is in Europe, which is where I normally live.

- Option 2: Telco Customer Churn 
Similar to my first option but is using data from IBM.

- Option 3: Company Bankruptcy Prediction
I think I am interested in a job similar to this type of problem. I find this dataset very interesting. It has a lot of columns and might be more difficult to the churning dataset.
